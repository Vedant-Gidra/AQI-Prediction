# AQI Prediction

## Problem Statement

This project aims to **predict the Air Quality Index (AQI)** using various environmental and pollutant-based features such as levels of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3. Accurately forecasting AQI values can help in identifying pollution trends and aiding decision-makers in air quality management.

## Objective

- Build machine learning models to predict AQI from given features.
- Compare the performance of **XGBoost Regressor** and **Random Forest Regressor**.
- Analyze which model provides more accurate results and assess if one significantly outperforms the other.

## Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values and outliers.
   - Normalized and cleaned the dataset for consistency.
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Used pollutant concentrations as input features.
   - Derived AQI as the target variable.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Implemented **Random Forest Regressor** and **XGBoost Regressor**.
   - Used train-test split to validate performance.
4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Used metrics like **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **RÂ² Score** to evaluate models.
   - Compared results from both algorithms.

- Both **XGBoost** and **Random Forest** produced **similar results** in terms of prediction accuracy.
- The performance metrics showed only marginal differences, indicating both models are suitable for AQI prediction with this dataset.
